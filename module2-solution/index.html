			 Michael Jordan is the GOAT because he was named to 10 All-NBA first teams, essentially meaning he was among the best five players in basketball for 10 seasons.  He also added nine All-Defensive first-team selections over the course of his career.Jordan was the NBA’s most valuable player five times, and many believe he should have won even more. Most notably, it is widely believed that Karl Malone unjustly won the 1998 MVP over Jordan because writers believed Jordan had won enough. Jordan was also named the NBA’s defensive player of the year in 1988. By any calculation, Jordan is the greatest scorer the league has ever seen. He won a record 10 scoring titles, and boasted a career average of 30.1 points per game, the most in NBA history.

			Kobe Bryant

		<p id="kobe">
			Kobe Bryant is the GOAT because he is the reason why people love basketball. All over the world, people worship Bryant—as they should. The guy is simply the best. If you saw the Olympic Games in China where Kobe is revered as he should be, he got the loudest ovation out of all the thousands of athletes from all around the globe. This is because people recognize skill and talent when they see it. As Kobe would say, “You guys are playing checkers, I am playing chess,” or the more famous, “I have bigger fish to fry” in reference to Raja Bell. Later, as age and NBA miles caught up to him, Bryant's footwork and ability to hit tough, contested shots became the staple of his game. Part of Bryant's mass appeal was his "Black Mamba" persona and "Mamba Mentality."

			Lebron James
		</header>
		<p id="lebron">
			Lebron is the GOAT because when we talk about LeBron James, there hasn't been one athlete that has exceeded the expectations placed on his name in any sport like LeBron James. LeBron James' career averages: 27 points, 7.5 assists, 7.5 rebounds. And let's take it a step further. We're talking about a LeBron James that's arguably probably going to end up No. 1 or No. 2 on the NBA all-time scoring list. We're talking about a LeBron James that's going to end up top five in assists. We're talking about a LeBron James that's going to end up with 10,000-plus rebounds. That makes him the best all-around NBA player of all-time. LeBron James has played 17 years in the NBA. He's went to the Finals nine times, eight in a row. That's more than 50% of his career spent in the Finals.
